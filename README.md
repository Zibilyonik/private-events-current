# Private Events

This project is a platform for people to create, share and attend events. Guests can register to the platform, create and attend events, find info about other users and see the events created by other users.

## Built With

* Ruby version: 2.7.1

* Rails 6.0.3.1

* HTML / CSS / Sass

## Getting Started
You will need Ruby ver. 2.7.1 installed on your system, which you can do so by visiting https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and following the directions from there depending on your system.

After that, all you have to do to be able to run this project is to make sure that you use **bundle:install** command to make sure all of the gems are installed. Afterwards, you can run **rails s** command to start up the server and use it as you will.

To access the running server, you can visit localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 (the default port, may change if you've used a different setting)
